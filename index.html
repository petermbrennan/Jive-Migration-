		<h1> This is where Jive content is hosted</h1>

		<h4> Content is hosted as static webpages. </h4>
		<h4> Put together by some intern named Pete. </h4>
		<h4> A few things to note: </h4>
		<p> Links will not work - need to change them to refference Amazon hosted pages rather than Jive. However, most images will show up on the <br/>
			page. You just won't be able to click on them.</p>
		<p> Some images will not work. All Jive hosted images have been reuploaded to s3 and refferenced in the HTML, but images that were hosted <br/> 
			in different locations will not show up in pages becasue they are surrounded by backslashes in the HTML. Should be relitivly easy to fix <br/>
			this if the need arises. For the time being, if you wish to view an image that isn't showing up, you can... </p>
			<ul><li>right click it</li> 
				<li>click inspect</li> 
				<li>right click the image src which should look like this: src=\"http://go.getg5.com/l/47492/2016-08-23/45zmwc/47492/87520/G5_white_R_01__1_.png\" and chose edit as html</li>
				<li>then remove the slashes it so that it looks like this:  src="http://go.getg5.com/l/47492/2016-08-23/45zmwc/47492/87520/G5_white_R_01__1_.png" </li> </ul>
		<p>Any questions should be emailed to pbrennan3@elon.edu </p>
